# Users & Groups

Linux has users, similar to accounts on Windows and MacOS. Every user has their own home directory. Users can also be part of groups.
There is a special user called ‘root’. Root is allowed to do anything.
To gain temporary root permissions, you can type ‘sudo’ in front of a command, but that only works if you’re allowed to do that.
Some actions require (root) permissions.
Users, passwords, and groups are all stored in  (different) files across the system.




## Opdracht

    - The new user should be part of an admin group that also contains the user you created during installation.
    - The new user should have a password.
    - The new user should be able to use ‘sudo’

2. Locate the files that store users, passwords, and groups. See if you can find your newly created user’s data in there.
