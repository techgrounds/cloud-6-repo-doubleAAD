# [GIT-01]

Git is officially defined as a *distributed version control system* (VCS).
In other words, it's a system that tracks changes to our project files over time.
It enables us to record project changes and go back to a specific version of the tracked files, at any given point in time. This system can be used by many people to efficiently work together and, where each developer can have their own version of the project, distributed on their computer. Later on,
these individual versions of the project can be merged and adapted into the main version of the project.
Basically, it's a massively popular tool for coordinating parallel work and managing projects among individuals and teams.

## Key-terms
[
-**Repository**: When working with Git, it's important to be familiar with the term Repository. A Git repository is a container for a project that is tracked by Git.  
We can single out two major types of Git repositories:
- Local repository - an isolated repository stored on your own computer, where you can work on the local version of your project.
- Remote repository - generally stored outside of your isolated local system, usually on a remote server. It's especially useful when working in teams - this is the place where you can share your project code, see other people's code and integrate it into your local version of the project, and also push your changes to the remote repository.

-**Main / Master**: Master is a naming convention for a branch. After cloning (downloading) a project from a remote server, the resulting local repository has a single local branch: the so-called "master" branch. This means that "master" can be seen as a repository's "default" branch.

-**Branch**: A Branch could be interpreted as an individual timeline of our project commits.
With Git, we can create many of these alternative environments (i.e. we can create different branches) so other versions of our project code can exist and be tracked in parallel.
That allows us to add new (experimental, unfinished, and potentially buggy) features in separate branches, without touching the 'official' stable version of our project code (which is usually kept on the master branch).
When we initialize a repository and start making commits, they are saved to the master branch by default.

-**Commit**:  A commit is a snapshot of our code at a particular time, which we are saving to the commit history of our repository. 

-**Push / Pull**: push sends the recent commit history from your local repository up to GitHub. A pull grabs any changes from the GitHub repository and merges them into your local repository.

-**Merge**: You can merge branches in situations where you want to implement the code changes that you made in an individual branch to a different branch. For example, after you fully implemented and tested a new feature in your code, you would want to merge those changes to the stable branch of your project (which is usually the default master branch).

-**Fork**: Fork is basically Copying an existed repositroy.
