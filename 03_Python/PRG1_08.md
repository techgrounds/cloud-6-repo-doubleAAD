# Key-value pairs
Key-value pairs are a general concept you will definitely encounter. Some examples of where you will find them are NoSQL databases or AWS resource tags. Dictionaries (dict) in Python also use key-value pairs to store information.



## Opdracht 1

- Create a new script.
- Create a dictionary with the following keys and values:
    
Key                 Value

First name          Coen
Last name           Meulenkamp
Job title           Learning Coach
Company             TechGrounds

- Loop over the dictionary and print every key-value pain in the terminal.


        val = {"first_name": "Coen","last_name": "Meulenkamp","job_title": "Learning Coach","Company": "Techgrounds"}
        for x, y in val.items():
            print(x, y)

## Opdracht 2

- Create a new script.
- Use user input to ask for their information (first name, last name, job title, company). Store the information in a dictionary.
- Write the information to a csv file (comma-separated values). The data should not be overwritten when you run the script multiple times.


        import csv

        dict = {}

        val = ["first name", "last name", "job title", "company"]
        for x in val:
            dict[i] = input("Please enter your {}: ".format(i))
        with open('../03_Python\csv\imp.csv', 'a', newline='') as f:
            writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames = val)
        writer.writerow(imp)
